Description:

	FastLane is a racing game where the player objective's is to drive their car and reach the goal banner placed at a certain point of the road. In trying to do so, the player will encounter
various other cars who are driving in the opposite direction (as in, towards the player). The player must avoid these cars, because one collision will be enough to destroy the player's car
and, thus, lose the game. As mentioned before, the player can win the game by reaching the goal banner (colored in green and yellow) before crashing into the other cars. If the player collides and
loses, they will be given the option to restart from the beginning; if they win, they can play again. Because the cars are generated randomly, and because the cars will also move at different
speeds depending on the car type, there will be no car pattern to follow for the player on subsequent playthroughs. How easy or difficult the game is will be somewhat randomly determined.
	The player will not be allowed to move up or down; they can only move from left to right (the game is an automatic scroller). Avoiding the opposing cars can thus only be done by moving
laterally while the car is in forward motion. In all, I (the designer) wish to impart a feeling of constant quick reaction on the player; avoiding cars should be seen as a relief, and seeing the
goal banner coming up should foster a sense of both relief and anticipation upon the player (due to winning the game and surviving the incoming cars).
